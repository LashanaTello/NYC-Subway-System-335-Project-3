  Description    : The interface file for the SubwaySystem class
  Purpose        : To provide a means of representing New York City's subway 
									 system
  Usage          : To serve as a database of New York City's subway system and 
									 allow user to query about the subway system, such as, the 
									 closest subway stations, subway entrances, and subway lines 
									 to a user-given latitude and longitude, all the entrances at 
									 a particular station, all the stations that serve a 
									 particular train line, and all the subway stations

/*******************************************************************************

		The SubwaySystem class acts as database for the New York City subway system. 
		It encapsulates a vector that stores pairs of Entrance objects and an 
		index, a SubwayStationHash object, and a SubwayLineHash object. The vector 
		represents disjoint sets of Entrance objects. Meaning, the vector is 
		a bunch of parent trees of entrances. The parent entranceâ€™s second pair 
		value will always be negative and reflects how many entrances are in its 
		set, including itself. All other entrances that are not parents are 
		children, and their second pair value will always be a positive integer, 
		which is the index of its parent in the vector. The vector is used to 
		create SubwayStation objects, and SubwayStation objects are used to create 
		SubwayLine objects. The SubwayStationHash object is a hash table that 
		provides fast access to all SubwayStation objects. The SubwayLineHash object 
		is a hash table that provides fast access to SubwayLine objects. When a 
		SubwaySystem object is created, all Entrance objects must be added to it 
		first, and then the method make_subway_system must be called to create the 
		SubwayStation objects, the SubwayLine objects, the SubwayStationHash object, 
		and the SubwayLineHash object. SubwaySystem uses the enumerated type 
		LineValue that is defined in the Entrance class's header file. 
		There are 451 subway stations and 26 train lines in New York City.
