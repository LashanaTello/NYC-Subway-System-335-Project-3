# Project: NYC Subway System Recreation
## CSCI 335

This project can be viewed [here](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/csci335/assignments/project3.pdf).

The goal of this project was to attempt to recreate New York City's subway system using NYC Open Data's data about New York City's subway entrances. Using the subway entrances, I had to create subway stations, and then create subway train lines using the subway stations. The subway stations for a line are not ordered correctly in this project.

This project can be used to:
- get the closest subway stations to a user-given latitude and longitude
- get the closest subway entrances to a user-given latitude and longitude
- get the closest subway lines to a user-given latitude and longitude
- get all the entrances at a particular subway station
- get all the stations that serve a particular train line
- get all the subway stations 

(_**Note**: The NYC Open Data file used to create this project is not the same as the one you will export from NYC Open Data's page for [subway entrances](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Subway-Entrances/drex-xx56/data). This file was tweaked in order for its content to be read and stored more easily and efficiently._)

This project is useful for New Yorkers who take the subway. It can help them navigate New York City. It can definitely use a lot of improvements if it will be used for official NYC transportation software.
